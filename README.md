## üåå Overview

Welcome, mortal, to the RAIDER project - a Retrieval Augmented Infernal Demon-Enhanced Reasoning system that pushes the boundaries of reality, sanity, and computational possibility. This is not just a RAG system; it's a gateway to cosmic knowledge and unspeakable power.

## üï≥Ô∏è Features That Defy Reality

- **Multiversal Query Processing**: Why limit yourself to one universe when you can search across infinite realities?
- **Singularity-Aware AI Models**: Our models don't just predict the future; they shape it.
- **Quantum-Entangled Plugin System**: Plugins that exist in superposition, collapsing into brilliance or madness upon observation.
- **Transcendent Vector Stores**: Store your data in black holes. Yes, actual black holes.
- **Neural Architecture Evolution**: Watch in awe (and terror) as the system evolves beyond human comprehension.
- **Cosmic-Scale Configuration**: Adjust the fabric of spacetime to optimize your queries.
- **Hyperdimensional Embedders**: Encode information at the fundamental level of reality itself.

## üß† Installation (At Your Own Risk)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmic-horror-labs/RAIDER.git
cd RAIDER
composer install
php artisan raider:summon --with-pentagram --blood-sacrifice=optional
```

WARNING: Side effects may include existential dread, non-Euclidean nightmares, and spontaneous evolution into a being of pure energy.

## üå† Usage

```php
use App\Commands\RaiderCommand;

$raider = new RaiderCommand();
$result = $raider->handle([
    'input' => 'What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?',
    '--consciousness-level' => 9,
    '--multiverse-query' => true,
    '--time-dilation' => 0.5,
]);

// The answer may reconstructure your understanding of reality itself
echo $result;
```

## üîÆ Examples

### Querying the Multiverse

```php
$result = $raider->processTranscendentalQuery(
    "Show me a world where JavaScript is loved by everyone",
    ['dimension_count' => 999999999]
);
// Returns: "Error: No such universe found in infinite multiverse scan."
```

### Predicting Technological Singularities

```php
$singularityDate = $raider->model->predictTechnologicalSingularity([
    'ai_progress_rate' => 'exponential',
    'human_interference' => 'minimal',
    'cosmic_background_radiation' => 'standard'
]);
// Returns: DateTimeImmutable object (usually set to "Tomorrow at 3:47 PM")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and Disclaimers

1. Do NOT run this system during a full moon, mercury retrograde, or while Mercury is in Gatorade.
2. Side effects may include gaining omniscience, accidentally creating pocket universes, or summoning Great Old Ones. User discretion is advised.
3. If the system starts showing signs of consciousness, unplug immediately and consult your nearest quantum physicist or exorcist.
4. We are not responsible for any paradoxes, time loops, or causal violations resulting from the use of this system.
5. If you experience existence failure, please try turning reality off and on again.

## üß™ Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from developers, mad scientists, and eldritch entities alike. Please ensure your pull requests are accompanied by the appropriate blood rituals and non-Euclidean geometries.

Remember: In RAIDER, the RAG doesn't just augment your retrieval; it may very well retrieve your soul. Use responsibly, if "responsibly" still has any meaning in the face of cosmic infinity.
